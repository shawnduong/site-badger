		<h1>What's Badger?</h1>
		<p>Badger is a system that streamlines many logistical functions associated with attendees at large events. With Badger, you can manage registration, attendance, incentive, rewards, and more with complete ease.</p>
		<p>Through Badger's admin management panel, you can make manage announcements, stamps, rewards, and much more. Through the Badger user web panel, attendees can view their statistics, be informed of announcements and events, claim rewards, and redeem codes. From registration and check-in to attendance and rewards, Badger streamlines your event.</p>

		<h1>It Starts With The Badge</h1>
		<p>Badger uses RFID cards operating at 13.56 MHz as badges for attendees. When an attendee scans their card, their card's information is instantly sent to a web API in order to process the transaction associated with the scanner &mdash; depending on the scanner's currently assigned function, the attendee might be registering for the first time, gaining points for going to an event or workshop, redeeming a stamp on their stamp card, or retrieving a reward.</p>
		<p>Badger scanners are portable and able to be powered via a micro USB cable or with 4x AA batteries. Badger scanners can operate unmanned, freeing you from the need for a battery pack or outlet.</p>

		<h1>Proven Technology</h1>
		<p>The Badger prototype first debuted at <a href="https://hackmerced.com/" target="_blank">HackMerced VIII</a> where it streamlined logistical functions for hundreds of attendees. In addition to managing registration, incentivizing event and workshop participation by rewarding redeemable points, and streamlining food distribution through the stamp card system, Badger also provided a single central channel to display the event schedule and make announcements.</p>
		<h1>Affordable</h1>
		<p>Badger is a unique low-cost solution for streamlining attendance-related logistical functions at events. Each badge costs less than $0.60 to manufacture and each scanner costs less than $10 to create. Cloud infrastructure costs vary depending on the cloud provider, but are typically inexpensive for Badger's needs.</p>
		<h1>Open Source and Actively Developed</h1>
		<p>Badger is open source and being actively developed. Now that the prototype has passed its proof-of-concept with flying colors and amazing performance, Badger will continue with the development of the Badger One. All source code and schematics are freely accessible on <a href="https://github.com/shawnduong/badger" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Units will be available for purchase soon as the Badger One development phase continues.</p>
		<h1>Go Badger!</h1>
		<p>Badger is a great way to get rid of plenty of headache associated with handling an event with a large number of attendees. Want Badger to take away your headache? Contact <a href="mailto:badger@shawnd.xyz">badger@shawnd.xyz</a>.</p>
